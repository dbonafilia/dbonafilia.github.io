# Welcome!

I'm currently a software/research engineer based in Seattle, Washington

I'm interested in machine learning and AI. I'm particularly interested in leveraging
these technologies for positive social impact. Currently, I'm most interested in
green energy and sustainability applications. Most recently, I've been working 
on AI powered mapping and remote sensing to contribute to open source maps at Facebook.
