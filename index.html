# Welcome!

I'm currently a software/research engineer based in Seattle, Washington.

Some of my work has been featured in outlets like
[Tech](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/gangogh/)[Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/facebooks-ai-team-maps-out-where-everyone-in-africa-lives/), 
[Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90331895/facebook-has-created-an-insanely-detailed-map-of-where-everyone-in-africa-lives), and [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49091093?fbclid=IwAR2Uoku7oH-Iyai29mCHzRfxmFc1Al67_yNS06IELKlEM1NtDiPQuwH4lYc).

I'm interested in machine learning and AI. I'm particularly interested in leveraging
these technologies for positive social impact. Currently, I'm most interested in
green energy and sustainability applications. Most recently, I've been working 
on AI powered mapping and remote sensing to contribute to open source maps at Facebook.

## World's Most Accurate Population Density Maps(HRSL)
![]( {{ "assets/popdensimage.gif"" | relative_url }})

The High Resolution Settlement Layer(HRSL) is the world's most accurate population density map. Working as an engineer on the
World.AI team at Facebook, I found a novel combination of semi-supervised and weakly supervised learning that vastly improved
the accuracy of the world's most accurate population density maps. This work was 
[published in CVPR 2019's Computer Vision for Global Challenges Workshop]
(https://research.fb.com/publications/building-high-resolution-maps-for-humanitarian-aid-and-development-with-weakly-and-semi-supervised-learning/https://research.fb.com/publications/building-high-resolution-maps-for-humanitarian-aid-and-development-with-weakly-and-semi-supervised-learning/) and explained in detail in a pair of blog posts published on Facebook's 
[AI](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/mapping-the-world-to-help-aid-workers-with-weakly-semi-supervised-learning/) and 
[Tech](https://tech.fb.com/ai-powered-maps-help-vaccination-campaigns/) blogs. This worked involved automatically scaling a 
training data set from around 1 million iamges to 100's of millions of images and improving the accuracy of the final model
by more than 12%.
