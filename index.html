# Welcome!

I'm currently a software/research engineer based in Seattle, Washington.

Some of my work has been featured in outlets like
[Tech](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/gangogh/)[Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/facebooks-ai-team-maps-out-where-everyone-in-africa-lives/), 
[Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90331895/facebook-has-created-an-insanely-detailed-map-of-where-everyone-in-africa-lives), and [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49091093?fbclid=IwAR2Uoku7oH-Iyai29mCHzRfxmFc1Al67_yNS06IELKlEM1NtDiPQuwH4lYc).

I'm interested in machine learning and AI. I'm particularly interested in leveraging
these technologies for positive social impact. Currently, I'm most interested in
green energy and sustainability applications. Most recently, I've been working 
on AI powered mapping and remote sensing to contribute to open source maps at Facebook.

## World's Most Accurate Population Density Maps(HRSL)
![]( {{ "assets/popdensimage.gif"" | relative_url }})

The High Resolution Settlement Layer(HRSL) is the world's most accurate population density map. Working as an engineer on the
World.AI team at Facebook, I found a novel combination of semi-supervised and weakly supervised learning that vastly improved
the accuracy of the world's most accurate population density maps. This work was 
[published](https://research.fb.com/publications/building-high-resolution-maps-for-humanitarian-aid-and-development-with-weakly-and-semi-supervised-learning/https://research.fb.com/publications/building-high-resolution-maps-for-humanitarian-aid-and-development-with-weakly-and-semi-supervised-learning/)
in CVPR 2019's Computer Vision for Global Challenges Workshop and explained in detail in a pair of blog posts published on Facebook's 
[AI](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/mapping-the-world-to-help-aid-workers-with-weakly-semi-supervised-learning/) 
and [Tech](https://tech.fb.com/ai-powered-maps-help-vaccination-campaigns/) blogs. This worked involved automatically scaling a 
training data set from around 1 million images to 100's of millions of images and improving the accuracy of the final model
by more than 12%. This work also automated the process of getting training data for new countries, allowing the team to
begin releasing population maps for more countries in a few months than it had in all of the proceeding years of the project. 
This work is being used today by organizations like the Red Cross and The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
to save lives.

## Map With AI

[Map With AI](https://mapwith.ai) is a suite of tools from Facebook to enable faster and more accurate mapping to the open mapping community.
Working as an engineer on the World.AI team at Facebook, I developed a weakly supervised training regime to improve the accuracy
and generalizability of the model that powers the Map With AI suite of tools. Because of this work, we were able to produce 
accurate results for countries on 6 continents around the world. Prior to the development of this method, results could only be 
accurately and reliably produced for Indonesia and Thailand &mdash; two countries on the same continent. On a sampling of test countries
this training regime led to an average relative accuracy improvement of 62%.
